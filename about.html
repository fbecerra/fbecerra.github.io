					<h2>Hello!</h2>
					<h2>Iâ€™m <strong>Fernando Becerra</strong></h2>
					<p>It has always been hard for me to choose one topic that defines me, because I'm interested in a wide range of topics such as science, politics, public policy, sports, education, photography, books, and so many other things that I can't think of right now.
						But not so long ago I realized that all this time there has been an underlying topic that I hadn't noticed: <em>storytelling</em>.
						I creative interactive visualizations to find and tell the stories that data hides; I take pictures and write because I want to tell landscape and people's stories through my lens and pen; and I travel because I like to hear everyone else's stories, discover their culture, and learn from them.
						Here you are going to find a mix of all of that: data science projects, visualizations, photographies, writing, travels, and much more. Thank you for visiting and I hope you get in touch!

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I was born and raised in Chile, and lived there until I was 24, when I moved to the US.
						I got a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Astronomy from <a href="http://www.das.uchile.cl" target="_blank">Universidad de Chile</a>, and then a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Astrophysics from <a href="https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard University</a>.
						I did <a href="http://fernandobecerra.com/astro/" target="_blank">astronomy research</a> for more than 12 years, studying how the formation of stars is related to the properties of the host galaxy, and figuring out how the first black holes in the Universe were formed.
						It was fun and I really enjoyed it, but after so many years working on astronomy I wanted to try something that would allow me to work on other topics.
						So, after I graduated in 2018 I moved to the field of information design.
					</p>
					<p>My first approach to information design was when I was still in school and took a Data Visualization class.
						The main reason why I did it was because it looked cool and fun, but I was immediately amazed by its usefulness and the whole spectrum of topics where I could apply those skills.
						I got exicted and started creating my own visualizaitons in my free time, using data from <a href="http://fernandobecerra.com/natural_disasters/" target="_blank">natural disasters</a>, <a href="http://fernandobecerra.com/ex2/" target="_blank">exoplanets</a>, and whatever other dataset I had in hand.
						Once I graduated, I took a position as a Data Visualization Developer at <a href="http://fathom.info" target="_blank">Fathom Information Design</a>, where I spent one year creating tools to <a href="http://laniakea.fathom.info" target="_blank">explore</a> and <a href="https://myriscope.com/" target="_blank">understand</a> large document collections.
						Fathom gave me a lot of creative room to develop my own ideas, which I used to do a <a href="https://fathom.info/bobross" target="_blank">Bob Ross piece</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/fathominfo/the-joy-of-parsing-4addce08969a" target="_blank">explore his paintings</a>.
						But at the end of that year I was ready to move on to the next adventure, so I left work and started traveling.
					</p>
					<p><a href="https://katynewlin.com" target="_blank">Katy</a> -my partner in life- and I had had the idea in our minds for a long time.
						We planned on taking some time off to travel all the way from Boston to Patagonia by bike, in a project that we called <a href="https://theslowtraverse.com" target="_blank">The Slow Traverse</a>.
						We saved enough money to buy our bikes and all the equipment we needed, and left our home to head towards Kingston, ON, where Katy's grandparents live.
						It took us 8 days to bike the more than 600 kms, we met really wonderful people, we had good and bad days, and the experience was gratifying overall.
						We restarted our bike trip after we spent some days in Kingston in order to cross Canada all the way to British Columbia, but after a couple of days we decided to stop.
						We were craving nature, mountains, trees, but the landscape in Ontario wasn't like that, so it was time to come up with another plan.
					</p>
					<p>It took us a few weeks to decide that we wanted to buy a van, build it up, and keep traveling by car.
						We bought our van in Toronto, drove it to Katy's parent's in Kentucky, and spent one and a half months building up a beautiful van that ended up being our home for the next few months.
						We drove West to visit the National Parks in the US: Badlands, Grand Teton, Yellowstone, Glacier, Redwoods, and Yosemite.
						One and a half months after we left Kentucky we were crossing the US-Mexico border, visiting places from Baja California all the way down to Chiapas, and then all the way back up to Tamaulipas, spending a total of 3.5 months there.
						But things happen, we got a bit tired and the COVID-19 pandemic started, so we had to end our trip and go back home to stay safe.
					</p>
					<p>And here we are.
						I'm currently working as a freelancer doing projects on Data Science and Data Visualization.
						Our plan for the short term is to find a piece of land and build a (not so) tiny house that we can call home.
						I don't know how long it might take, I don't know if we are going to change our plans yet once again, but it's going to be wonderful.
						Life is an adventure with ups and downs, and we are always open to new challenges.
						Whatever it brings, we'll welcome it with open arms.
