            <p>It wasn't until I was living in Boston, at the age of 24, that I had my first semi professional camera.
              I bought it after coming back from a trip to Torres del Paine National Park in Chile and realized that all the pictures I took with my point-and-shoot were blurry.
              (I blamed it on the camera, of course.)
              Until then, photography was just a medium to record images and memories of the places I visited while backpacking and camping, but, given the investment I had just made, I decided to take it a bit more seriously.
              So I started watching online tutorials, reading books, and everything else that a person initiating in photography does, including taking more pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
              The switch to seeing photography as a way of making a living happened slowly; the more I traveled, the more pictures I took, and the more I enjoyed it.
              But everything came together and I finally saw it crystal clear when Katy and I decided to embark on a however-long-it-takes adventure through the American continent.
              Since September 2019, we have been living in a van, visiting many wonderful places, including several National Parks, in each country of the Americas.
              This was the event that inspired me and, more importantly, gave me enough time to finally work on my pictures and share them with the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been a long way to get to this point, which included leaving my family in Chile and moving to the US to get a degree in <a href="http://www.fernandobecerra.com/astro" target="_blank">Astronomy</a>, then leaving the career I had built as an astronomer to work for a year in <a href="#" target="_blank">information design</a>, and finally leaving that job once we finally saved up enough money.
              And that decision wasn't motivated by a desire of self-growth, a way to find my true vocation, or the typical mid-life crisis of a privileged middle-class guy, but by the push to explore new places, to interact with people, and to learn from other cultures -- to see the world as it is, with all its good and bad things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, in case they are useful to you too, I would like to share some of the resources that have inspired me, taught me, and allowed me to develop my own photographic style:
